## how to use:
exl_ranking is the official file.

The excel file that you submit must have the following structure:

Row 1: Free cell, names of the criteria  
Row 2: Free cell, the weights(importance) of the criteria (TBC - the weights should sum up to 1)  
Row 3: Free cell, what is the tendency the criteria should go (min or max)  
Row 4-end: Name of the object, values of each criteria  

The .exe file is located in the dist folder.

## NOTES:
Note1: You can use a sample file in this repository as a demo - in that case the derictory is ".", the file is "TOPSIS_sample.xlsx".
Note2: If you use the exl_ranking.exe file, you will have to wait about 10-15s before it starts, so do not close it. If you use exl_ranking.py it will be much quicker.
